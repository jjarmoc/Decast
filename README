DeCast.pl
---------
Decoder for CAST encoded SQL attacks.  Accepts the payload as either STDIN or a file argument, outputs decoded CAST (following multiple levels recursively) including whois and dig output.

This is useful for quickly analyzing payloads of many of the mass SQL injection attacks, including Asprox, Lizamoon, and Lilupophilupop.
